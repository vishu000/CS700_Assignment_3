// Homework Grade Maximization: In a class, there are n assignments. You have H
// hours to spend on all assignments, and you cannot divide an hour between assignments,
// but must spend each hour entirely on a single assignment. The i-th hour you spend
// on assignment j will improve your grade on assignment j by B[i, j], where for each j,
// B[1, j] ≥ B[2, j] ≥ · · · ≥ B[H, j] ≥ 0. In other words, if you spend h hours on assignment
// j, your grade will be Ph
// i=1 B[i, j], and time spent on each project has diminishing returns,
// with the next hour being worth less than the previous one. You want to divide your H
// hours between the assignments to maximize your total grade on all the assignments. Give
// an efficient algorithm for this problem
